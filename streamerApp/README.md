# How to use
- run by `python main.py` (suggested for full features)
    - you will need to run `pip install -r requirements.txt` first
- you will need to set the obs password in `secret.py`
- 


Make sure that secret.py is set to your obs websocket password (for now)

# interesting suggestions
- You can use this to have multiple obs windows on different computers to output 1 screen onto another and modify all sources from 1 place
    - even allowing chat to help
